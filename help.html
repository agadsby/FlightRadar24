<p><strong>Local Flightradar24 Radar Plot</strong></p>
<p>This page shows the output being seen by the local FR24 receiver. It was created to visualise the data obtained by the feed. Only aircraft with transponders providing lat/lon information will be shown on the radar plot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each aircraft is shown at its current position with a line showing the vector the aircraft will travel at its current speed and heading in the next minute. The colour of the line represents the altitude using standard FR24 <a href="https://support.fr24.com/support/solutions/articles/3000115027-why-does-the-aircraft-s-trail-change-colour-">colours</a>.&nbsp; The "tell" next to the aircraft gives its callsign and altitude.</p>
<p>Clicking on the current location of a displayed arcraft will open a new window showing details of that flight using the offical FR24 site.</p>
<p>A table showing more information about all of the aircraft that are seen by the receiver AND are reporting a lat/long position.</p>
<p>The display updates every 5 seconds.</p>

<p>To change the range of the displayed plot simply update the Max Range field below the plot - the unit is Nautical Miles.</p>
<p>To filter the display based on reported altitude simply change the Min and Max Alt fields - the unit is Feet.</p>
